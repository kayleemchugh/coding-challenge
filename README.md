Hi all! Thanks for letting me give this a go. 
<br />
My process: 
<br />
Upon receiving this assignment, two thoughts immediately came to mind -- 
<br />
-- I didn't want to waste time parsing weakly typed objects.
-- I didn't want to get caught up fine tuning the styling and ui work. 
<br />
I therefore decided to prioritize adding in a css framework or library, and adding Typescript to the project so I could utilize strictly typed objects. I imported the proper libraries through yarn, set up my models, and got to work!
<br/>
I implemented TailwindCSS, a pretty awesome lightweight framework to take care of most of the UI work. When it came time to build the modal, I also added in material ui. You can create modals with Tailwind, but it takes longer than I think this assignment would have allotted. 
<br />
While this isn't the biggest table in the world, it did have potential to become quite messy. I wanted to make sure I practiced clean code, and made sure to break the table and subsequent rows into their own components. While I know this is just a small assignment, I always thinking about extendability when writing code, and about the ability for others to clearly read the code I write. I believe the small components I setup for this assignment meet this criteria. I also utilized hooks when possible. I really like them, and know they're becoming incredibly popular!  
<br/>
Next steps: 
<br/>
If I had time, I would have absolutely cleaned up the UI further. There is something very calming about being able to perfectly match a mock up :) 
I would have also completed the final task - to implement status filtering. I chose to spend a little more time on the ui than moving ahead to the final step, since the UI work was higher on the assigned priority list.  
<br/>
Thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to complete this!
